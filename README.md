# microcontroller_project
#list of component:
1. Arduino mega
2. TCS230 Color sensor
3. 5 stepper motor
4. 1 I2C LCD
5. Some led light
6. Wire
7. Rubik's cube

Demo of the project: https://youtu.be/Z9bUgIMS0hQ?si=a690TO4I3rA2x-jR

The demo consists of three parts:

Input Module: Captures input using an Arduino Mega and a color sensor.

Cube-Solving Module: Processes the input from the Input Module, generates solution steps for solving the cube on the ATmega32 controller, and executes those steps via stepper motors.

Cube-Solving Demonstration: Showcases the physical process of solving a Rubikâ€™s Cube using the designed hardware system.
